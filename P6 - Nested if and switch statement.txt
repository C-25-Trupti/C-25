Program 6 : Nested If And Switch Statement

Code 1

#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int x,y;
    printf("Enter a number between 0 to 39: ");
    scanf("%d",&y);
    
    if (y/10==0)
    {
        printf("You have entered the number in the range of 0 to 9\n");
    }
    else if(y/10==1)
    {
        printf("You have entered the number in the range of 10 to 19\n");
    }
    else if (y/10==2)
    {
        printf("You have entered number in the range of 20-29\n");
    }
    else if (y/10==3)
    {
        printf("You have entered number in the range of 30-39\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("The number not in the range  \n");
    }
    return 0;
}

Output :

Enter a number between 0 to 39: 12
You have entered the number in the range of 10 to 19

Code 2

#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int x,y;
    printf("Enter a number between 0 to 39: ");
    scanf("%d",&y);
    x=y/10;
    switch (x)
    
    {
        case 0 :
        printf("You have entered the number in the range of 0 to 9\n");
        break;
        
        case 1 :
        printf("You have entered the number in the range of 10 to 19\n");
        break;
        
        case 2 :
        printf("You have entered number in the range of 20-29\n");
        break;
        
        case 3:
        printf("You have entered number in the range of 30-39\n");
        break ;
        
        default :
        printf("The number not in the range  \n");
    }
    return 0;
}

Output - 

Enter a number between 0 to 39: 33
You have entered number in the range of 30-39
