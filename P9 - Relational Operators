Program 9 - Relational Operators

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a,b;
printf(" Enter the values of a and b\n");
scanf ("%d %d", &a,&b);

if (a>b)
printf("%d is greater than  %d\n", a,b);

else if (a<b)
printf ("%d is less than %d\n", a,b);

if (a<=b)
printf("%d is less than or equal to %d\n", a,b);

else if (a>=b)
printf("%d is greater than or equal to %d\n", a,b);

if (a==b)
printf("%d is equal to %d\n", a,b);

else if (a!=b)
printf("%d is not equal to %d\n", a,b);

return 0;
}

Output :
5 
5
5 is less than or equal to 5
5 is equal to 5
